### âœ¨ [View the Interactive Project Hub](https://your-username.github.io/your-repo-name) âœ¨

---

A complete, full-stack web application designed for small businesses to manage product inventory, track sales, and provide a seamless shopping experience. This project features a modern React frontend and a robust backend powered by Node.js, Express.js, and a hybrid database system using both MySQL and MongoDB.

The highlight of this project is an **AI-powered sales forecasting model** that analyzes historical sales data to provide intelligent reordering suggestions, helping to prevent stockouts and optimize inventory levels.

## Key Features

-   **AI-Powered Sales Forecasting:** A smart assistant for admins that analyzes sales trends and predicts future demand to suggest which products need to be reordered.
-   **Secure Authentication:** JWT-based login and registration system with password hashing (`bcrypt`).
-   **Role-Based Access Control:** Differentiates between **Admin** (full CRUD access) and **Viewer** (read-only and purchasing) roles.
-   **Complete Inventory Management:** Admins can add, view, update, and delete products, including details like name, price, quantity, category, and images.
-   **Hybrid Database System:**
    -   **MySQL:** For structured, relational data (users, products, inventory, sales history).
    -   **MongoDB:** For flexible, unstructured data like product images (stored as base64) and metadata.
-   **Dynamic Frontend:** A clean, responsive UI inspired by modern e-commerce sites.
    -   **Category Navigation:** Browse products by specific categories or view all products.
    -   **Real-time Stock Updates:** Product cards intelligently update stock availability as items are added to the cart.
    -   **Search Functionality:** A modal-based search to quickly find products.
-   **Shopping Cart & Billing:**
    -   Users can add products to a cart and adjust quantities.
    -   Secure checkout process that updates inventory levels in real-time.
    -   Admins can track sales history for each user.
    -   Users can download a PNG image of their final bill.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### **1. Prerequisites**

Ensure you have the following software installed:
-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
-   [MySQL Server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)
-   [MongoDB Community Server](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/community)
-   A code editor like [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

---

### **2. Database Setup**

1.  **Start Services:** Ensure both your MySQL and MongoDB servers are running.
2.  **Create MySQL Database:** Log into your MySQL client and run the following command:
    ```sql
    CREATE DATABASE inventory_db;
    ```
3.  **Create Tables & Data:** Use the new database (`USE inventory_db;`) and then execute the **entire SQL script** provided in the project files. This will create all necessary tables and insert sample data.

---

### **3. Backend Setup**

1.  **Navigate to the backend folder:**
    ```bash
    cd backend
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
3.  **Create environment file:**
    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
4.  **Configure `.env` file:** Open the new `.env` file and fill in your MySQL credentials and a custom `JWT_SECRET`.

    > #### **Generating Your `JWT_SECRET`**
    > The `JWT_SECRET` is a private key that you create yourself. It's used to sign and verify the authenticity of user login tokens. It must be a long, random, and unpredictable string.
    >
    > -   **For quick development,** you can invent any long phrase:
    >     `JWT_SECRET=my-super-secure-inventory-app-secret-phrase-2025`
    >
    > -   **For better security (Recommended),** generate a random string using this command in your terminal:
    >     ```bash
    >     node -e "console.log(require('crypto').randomBytes(64).toString('hex'))"
    >     ```
    >     Copy the long string that is generated and paste it as the value for `JWT_SECRET` in your `.env` file.
    
5.  **Start the backend server:**
    ```bash
    node server.js
    ```
    The server should now be running on `http://localhost:5001`.

---

### **4. Frontend Setup**

1.  **Open a new terminal window.**
2.  **Navigate to the frontend folder:**
    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```
3.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
4.  **Start the frontend server:**
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    Your browser should automatically open to `http://localhost:3000`.

---

### **5. Usage**

-   Navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.
-   **Sign up** for a new user account, or log in with the default admin credentials:
    -   **Username:** `admin`
    -   **Password:** `admin123`
-   Explore the application!
